`hrep` is an R package that provides methods for 
representing and manipulating chord sequences.
It is currently still under active development,
but we plan an official release in 2019.

We recommend you explore the [online documentation](https://pmcharrison.github.io/hrep).

## Development notes

- The integer representation of a given representation
must begin at 1 and count upwards with no missing values.
0 can optionally be used to code missing chords (but this is not implemented here).
